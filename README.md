**RRhinox :rhinoceros: | Welcome folks! :wave:**
=============

Hello, I'm Roberto, Roby for friends - rob or "geronimOps" for some collegues. 

#### **Welcome to my little space in the infinite world of the Open Source Codes!**

Here I want to tidy up all my personal projects, work experience notes, and gists to give back to the web some useful information for some infrastructure maintenance technician friends like me (Ops Eng., IT Administrator, DevOps or Sys Admin etc.) .

## **About Me** :man_feeding_baby: :hammer_and_wrench: 

I'm a father who made the bash linux command line, his job. Interested in the whole life cycle of software, obsessed with performance, team work and DevOps culture!

Thanks to my brother example, I follow the mistery behind a keyboard and circuits that connect humans to the internet, like a detective :detective:.

I am naturally curious and hungry to learn something new every day and share knowledge and tricks, with my collegues.

## **About My Job** 
Linux - RedHat, CentOS, Ubuntu:penguin: Apache - httpd :feather:, Tomcat :tiger: 
AWS :cloud:, Docker :whale2:, Kubernetes :wheel_of_dharma: 

### **Summary story**
I'm a technician (like plumber or bricklayer) of linux servers expert in operations with interest in DevOps  culture and a eye of monitoring and performance.

### **The long story long**

### ***First steps***
I am always a novice technician, because I remember my first useful experience with hardware of computers and laptops (with lots of little screws, cpu, hdd, motherboards and ram) and the first level of support (in the help desk team).

I started to study on my own what my last year of computer science in high school, had only hinted at, javascript (with jquery) html, something php/mysql. Just enough to install joomla and wordpress on the cheapest hosting and propose to acquaintances to create (as well as experiment with) their own small website. We are still in the days of tables and much less of mobile design, but soon html5 and bootstrap will come among us with interesting new features.

### ***Middleware, Ops and DevOps***
I was offered to work in the middleware and operations team, where I fell in love with Linux operating systems (mainly centos and redhat). Since then I have mostly helped Java developers release sw into production in fairly complex infrastructure (although not very stable but by dint of hammering out code and configurations, then we fixed them).

I consider myself too much of a generalist (for some a virtue for others a flaw) and feel the need to specialize in an opensource tool. I've already been using <a href="https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-46-borg-and-k8s-with-john-wilkes/" alt="borg_podcats_google" target="_blank">Borg</a> oh sorry Kubernetes in production, about 4 years (not as an administrator) so I need to go deeper into it. Here's why I am currently studying a Linux Software Foundation course to become a certified Kubernetes administrator by the end of the year.

## **Working in progress** 
All this space and repos are a work in progress. Feel free to contact me with any questions or open source collaboration (but not to ask for money XD at most I'll buy you a coffee).
